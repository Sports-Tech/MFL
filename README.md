## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Welcome everyone to the initial **[McCurley Fantasty League](https://sleeper.app/leagues/516022205718880256/Sports-Tech/MFL/edit/master/README.md)** website.  This site will obviously mature, evolve, and become more aesthetically pleasing over time.  So please, bare with us on this journey.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sports-Tech/MFL/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
